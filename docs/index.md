    Bubble Bobble is a classic arcade game developed by Fukio Mitsuji and TAITO in 1986. The game features two Bubbledragon brothers on a mission to rescue their respective girlfriends. It's a fun, family-friendly cooperative game where players must defeat all the enemies on each level using bubbles. Bubble Bobble is widely regarded as one of the best games of all time, and our team has created a small tribute to this amazing classic. This wiki contains all the information and assets we used in our tribute.
